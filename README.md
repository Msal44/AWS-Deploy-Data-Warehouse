# AWS-Deploy-Data-Warehouse

Data warehousing is a critical component for analyzing and extracting actionable insights from your data. Amazon Redshift allows you to deploy a scalable data warehouse in a matter minutes and start to analyze your data right away using your existing business intelligence tools. Itâ€™s a fast, fully-managed, and cost-effective data warehousing system.

In this project, I created and configured an Amazon Redshift data warehouse, loaded sample data, and analyzed it using a SQL client.

What I accomplished accomplish:
Created an Amazon Redshift cluster from the AWS Management Console.

Configured the cluster by choosing the instance type and specifying the number of nodes.

Secured your cluster using AWS IAM and set it up for access.

Loaded sample data to your cluster from Amazon S3 after defining a schema and creating the tables.

Analyzed the data with query editor v2 in Amazon Redshift.
